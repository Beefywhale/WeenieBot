# Installing WeenieBot

First off, run `python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt` to install everything needed for WeenieBot to run. Create an application here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me to make a bot, than make the Bot a Bot Account by following the steps here: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2 make sure you set your application to Bot Account, that is very important! Right-click your discord name and click "Copy ID" than open WeenieBot.py and look for `admin = [""]` paste your ID in between the parenthases, and scroll all the way down until you find `client.run('Your-Bot-Token-Here!')` and replace Your-Bot-Token-Here, with your Application's Token, save and exit WeenieBot.py.

# Thats It!
now just `run python3 WeenieBot.py`
For more info on commands, use the !help command once the bot is up and running!
