if you want to install the bot yourself and run it on your own computer look for Harder Install section!

# Harder Install:
  First off, run `python setup.py` to setup everything needed for WeenieBot to run. Create an application here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me to make a bot, than make the bot a bot user
by following the steps here: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bot make sure you set your application to bot user, that is very important! Don't forget to add the bot to your server by copying your applications ClientID, than going to this link https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0 and pasting your Client ID in place of `CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE`.
